  difference between Early and Late Binding
  
  
 * binding *
 
 
 connecting method body to method call is know as binding.
 
 
 *  early binding  *
 
 => decided at the compile time then it is know as early binding method also
 know as overloading or polymorphism.
 
 ex.
 
 
class Animal{
 
 class Dog extends Animal{

 
 
 
 public static void main(STring args[]){
 dog ani=new Dog();
 

 
 }
 }
 
 
 
 * late binding *
 
 decided by the jvm at a runtime know as the late binding(method orrideing or polymorphism).
 
 
 exa 
 
 class Animal{
 
 void eat(){
   System.out.println("animal are eating);
 }
 
 class Dog extends Animal{
 void eat(){
 system.out.println("dog is eating")
 
 
 
 public static void main(STring args[]){
 Animal ani=new Dog();
 
 a.eat();
 
 }
 }
 }
