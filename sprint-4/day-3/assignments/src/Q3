Q3) Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.

                     ** equals() ** 
           
 >  The java equals() is a method of lang.Object class, and it is used to compare two objects.  
 
 >  To compare two objects that whether they are the same, it compares the values of both the object's attributes.   
 
 >   By default, two objects will be the same only if stored in the same memory location.
 
  Syntax:
          public boolean equals(Object obj);
          
 Parameter:
obj: It takes the reference object as the parameter, with which we need to make the comparison.       


Returns:
It returns the true if both the objects are the same, else returns false.

           ** hashcode() **
           
 >  A hashcode is an integer value associated with every object in Java, facilitating the hashing in hash tables.
 
 >  To get this hashcode value for an object, we can use the hashcode() method in Java. 
    It is the means hashcode() method that returns the integer hashcode value of the given object.  
    
 >  Since this method is defined in the Object class, hence it is inherited by user-defined classes also.
 
 >   The hashcode() method returns the same hash value when called on two objects, which are equal according to the equals() method.
     And if the objects are unequal, it usually returns different hash values.  
     
     
  Syntax:
         public int hashCode()  

Returns:
It returns the hash code value for the given objects.

example  ;-
         
       
         
         class Test_hash_equal{  
    public static void main(String[] args){  
        String a = "Andrew";  
        String b = "Andrew";  
  
        if(a.equals(b)){   //checking the equality of objects using equals() methods  
            System.out.println("a & b are equal variables, and their respective hashvalues are:" + " "+ a.hashCode() + " & " + b.hashCode());  
          
        }  
  
        String c = "Maria";  
        String d= "Julie";  
  
        if(!c.equals(d)){    //checking  the equality of objects using equals() method  
            System.out.println("\nc & d are Un-equal variables, and their respective hashvalues are:" + " "+ c.hashCode() + " & " + d.hashCode());  
              
        }  
    }  
}
