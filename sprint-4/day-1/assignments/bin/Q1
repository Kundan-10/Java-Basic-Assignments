Q1) Explain about the Marker interface?


=> It is an empty interface (no field or methods). Examples of marker interface are Serializable, Cloneable and Remote interface. 
All these interfaces are empty interfaces. 

=>

example:-

public interface Serializable 
{
  // nothing here
}

=>  It is used to deliver type information at runtime to the JVM so that it can take some action based on the information received. 
 One of the main purposes behind the ideology of marker interfaces is that they are used to convey a 
 message to the JVM that the class implementing this type of interface has some extra functionalities.
Popular examples of marker interfaces include Cloneable, Serializable, Remote Interface.
