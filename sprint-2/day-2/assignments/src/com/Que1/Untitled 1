difference between overloading and overriding methods 

 *  Overloading *

def:-   When two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters, it’s called Overloading.

=>  Overloading implements Compile time polymorphism.
=>  Overloading occurs between the methods in the same class.
=>  Overloaded method names are the same but the parameters are different.
=>  Overloading breaks, the compile-time error will come and it’s easy to fix.




*  Overriding * 

def:-   When the method signature (name and parameters) are the same in the superclass and the child class, it’s called Overriding.

=>  Overriding implements Runtime Polymorphism .
=> The method Overriding occurs between superclass and subclass. 
=>  Overriding methods have the same signature i.e. same name and method arguments.
=> If overriding breaks, it can cause serious issues in our program because the effect will be visible at runtime.
