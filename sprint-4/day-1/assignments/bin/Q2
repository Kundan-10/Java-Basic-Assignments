Q2) Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?

ans:-
The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity. Consider a case where class B extends
 class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display(). Now java compiler cannot decide, 
 which display method it should inherit. To prevent such situation, multiple inheritances is not allowed in java.
 
 

Multiple Inheritance is a feature of an object-oriented concept, where a class can inherit properties 
of more than one parent class. The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature 
in both the superclasses and subclass. On calling the method, the compiler cannot determine which class
 method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority.
