Q1) Differentiate between static and non-static variables?

Ans:-

instance/non-static varialble:--

1)  A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable.
2) It is not declared as static.
3) It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.



 Static variable

1) A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable.
2) It cannot be local.
3) You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. 
4) Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
