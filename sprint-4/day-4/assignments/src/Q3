) Explain the difference between comparable and
  comparator
  
  
       ** Comparable in Java **
       
  1)  Comparable interface is used to sort the objects with natural ordering.
  
  2)   Comparable interface compares “this” reference with the object specified.
  
  3)   Comparable is present in java.lang package.
  
  4)   Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.
  
  5)    Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.
  
  6)  1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. 
  In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.

     ** Comparator in Java **
     
  1)   Comparator in Java is used to sort attributes of different objects.
  
  2)  Comparator in Java compares two different class objects provided.
  
  3)   A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
  
  4)  Comparator doesn’t affect the original class
  
  5)  Comparator provides compare() method, equals() method to sort elements.
  
  60  he Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. 
  In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
